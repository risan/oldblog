Hi, my name is Risan Bagja Pradana ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a web developer with more than four years professional experience. Iâ€™ve been working
on various projects with some of the big brands such as LG, Mitsubishi, and
Samsung.

I'm passionate about coding. I enjoy spending time writing clean, readable, and
well-tested code. Iâ€™m open to any programming languages or frameworks, but I'm most experienced
with Javascript and PHP. Currently, Laravel, Node.js, and React are my favorite
stacks.

I'm from Indonesia but currently resides in Stockholm, Sweden. You can checkout my open-source projects on my [Github profile](https://github.com/risan). You can also reach me
at [risanbagja@gmail.com](mailto:risanbagja@gmail.com).

Thanks for visiting!
