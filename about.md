Hi, my name is Risan and I code for fun! Seriously.

![Hi, my name is Risan!](/img/risan.jpg)

I'm a stay-at-home husband who's passionate about coding. I love to code and build stuff with it. Just like playing with Lego. I got the thrills when seeing all of the pieces started to come together and finally working.

I started to code when I was just 14 years old. At that time I was in Junior High School and borrowed a book about Borland Delphi from my relative. I followed and practiced most of the tutorials on that book. I even still remember one of the very first programs I made: a simple rich text editor. Since then, programming became part of my hobbies.

I build this blog so it can be a journal for keeping things I learned throughout my journey as a passionate coder. This blog is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted for free on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)—you can take a look at entire source code [here](https://github.com/risan/risan.github.io).

Thank you for passing by! Check out my profiles on other websites too:

* My rambling on Twitter: [@risanbagja](https://twitter.com/risanbagja).
* My writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/risan)—mostly just the copies from this very blog.
